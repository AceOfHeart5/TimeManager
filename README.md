# Time Manager
This app was inspired by the pomodoro technique. 

The pomodoro technique was invented by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves setting a timer for 25 minutes, and committing to complete focus on a task during that time. When the 25 minutes are up you take a 5 minute break before beginning again. "Pomodoro" is Italian for "tomato", and the technique is named after the tomato shaped kitchen timer Cirillo first used.

## How To Use
Begin by creating a task under the Tasks column. Select a task by clicking on it. Click it again to deselect it. Although inspired by the pomodoro technique, you do not have to use 25 minute increments. Choose the time in minutes either by clicking the plus and minus buttons, or entering the value directly. Click the timer display to start counting down. As the timer counts down, time will be added to the selected task. A ring sound will play when the timer reaches 0.
